# Architecture Patterns

Architecture patterns explain how Cloudflare services fit together for real application designs.

Use this folder before writing code to choose the smallest useful design, understand data flow, and identify the production controls that matter.

## Standard architecture format

New or substantially revised architecture guides should include:

```md
# Architecture Name

## Goal
## Best for
## Not ideal for
## Smallest useful version
## Production upgrades
## Cloudflare services used
## Data and request flow
## Security and access rules
## Background jobs and failure handling
## Deployment and verification
## Cost and scaling notes
## Production checklist
## Common mistakes
## Related guides
```

A guide may use a shorter format only when it links clearly to shared foundation patterns.

---

## Freshness metadata

Cloudflare services change. New or substantially revised guides should include this block near the top:

```md
> Source: Official Cloudflare documentation
> Last checked: YYYY-MM-DD
> Risk level: Low / Medium / High
```

Use **Low** for stable general guidance, **Medium** for product behavior or pricing-sensitive advice, and **High** for preview, beta, or fast-changing features.

---

## Architecture rules

- Start with the simplest working design.
- Explain why each Cloudflare service is used.
- Say when a service is not required.
- Keep authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, and file permissions server-side.
- Use queues for work that does not need to block the user.
- Include failure modes and common mistakes.
- Link related catalog pages, playbooks, prompts, and templates.
- Keep Cloudflare facts fresh against official sources.
- Make the guide useful for both humans and AI coding agents.
