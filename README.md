# DeveloperB

> **From real problems to build-ready products.**

DeveloperB helps founders, clients, team members, and developers turn a real-world problem into a clear decision, useful documentation, a project blueprint, and a verified path to build.

## Authoritative operating standards

Before planning, designing, building, deploying, maintaining, or improving a Nakib-owned product, read:

1. [`docs/PRODUCT-ENGINEERING-BIBLE.md`](docs/PRODUCT-ENGINEERING-BIBLE.md) — single authoritative product and engineering operating standard.
2. [`docs/GROWTH-LAUNCH-AND-LIFECYCLE-STANDARD.md`](docs/GROWTH-LAUNCH-AND-LIFECYCLE-STANDARD.md) — mandatory companion for public/customer-facing projects covering social-platform readiness, SEO/LLM discoverability, analytics/pixels, AI-assisted metadata, launch readiness, post-launch monitoring, admin parity, and stack decisions.

Supporting standards:

- [`docs/NAKIB-PRODUCT-ENGINEERING-STANDARD.md`](docs/NAKIB-PRODUCT-ENGINEERING-STANDARD.md)
- [`docs/HUMAN-EXPERIENCE-AND-RESEARCH-STANDARD.md`](docs/HUMAN-EXPERIENCE-AND-RESEARCH-STANDARD.md)
- [`docs/BLOG-ARTICLE-AUTHORING-STANDARD.md`](docs/BLOG-ARTICLE-AUTHORING-STANDARD.md)
- [`docs/PORTFOLIO-COST-MAINTENANCE-STANDARD.md`](docs/PORTFOLIO-COST-MAINTENANCE-STANDARD.md)
- [`docs/PROJECT-REGISTRY-TEMPLATE.md`](docs/PROJECT-REGISTRY-TEMPLATE.md)

If a supporting document conflicts with the Bible, the Bible wins unless a project-specific accepted decision explicitly overrides it.

## DeveloperB private alpha

A person should be able to say:

> “This is the problem I face every day. I do not know whether I need a tool, a process change, automation, or a full product.”

DeveloperB guides the next decision:

```text
Natural language problem
→ confirmed facts, assumptions, and unanswered questions
→ solution options
→ recommendation and what not to build yet
→ accepted project blueprint
→ build workspace, tasks, AI guidance, evidence, and delivery
```

DeveloperB does not assume that a custom product is always the answer. It considers:

- Do not build yet
- Use an existing tool
- Improve the manual process
- Automate one workflow
- Build a lightweight internal tool
- Build a full software product

Start the private workspace at [`WORKSPACE.md`](WORKSPACE.md). Product architecture, data model, and build order are in [`private-alpha/README.md`](private-alpha/README.md).

## Cloudflare-friendly toolkit

This repository includes practical guidance for building and operating applications with Cloudflare services when they fit the technical need.

| --- | --- |
| Learning | Beginner-friendly explanations and roadmaps |
| Architecture | Reference designs for real application types |
| Templates | Reusable configs, folder structures, and starter files |
| Prompts | AI-ready build, audit, debug, and deploy prompts |
| Checklists | Production readiness, security, and deployment checks |
| Catalog | Simple explanations of Cloudflare services |

| SaaS app | [Multi-tenant SaaS](architectures/multi-tenant-saas.md) |
| Online store | [E-commerce](architectures/ecommerce.md) |
| Course platform | [LMS](architectures/lms.md) |
| Travel lead platform | [Travel Platform](architectures/travel-platform.md) |
| Real-time app | [Real-time Collaboration](architectures/realtime-collaboration.md) |
| Public API | [API Platform](architectures/api-platform.md) |

## Use with AI coding tools

```text
Read docs/PRODUCT-ENGINEERING-BIBLE.md and docs/GROWTH-LAUNCH-AND-LIFECYCLE-STANDARD.md first.
Then read BUILD-STATUS.md, WORKSPACE-STATUS.md, AGENTS.md, and the closest architecture guide.
Start from the real problem.
Separate confirmed facts, assumptions, and unanswered questions.
Consider build, buy, automate, process improvement, and do-not-build options.
Create a project only after an accepted blueprint.
Keep secrets out of source code and verify every important decision.
```

## Audit before deployment

Review environment variables, bindings, uploads, secrets, route safety, deployment target, security gaps, monitoring gaps, rollback readiness, analytics/tracking, SEO/indexability, social metadata/assets, admin usability, and post-launch monitoring. Start with [`docs/production-readiness-checklist.md`](docs/production-readiness-checklist.md) and [`docs/rollback-checklist.md`](docs/rollback-checklist.md).

## Design principles

- **Problem first:** understand the lived problem before proposing a product.
- **Simple first:** start with the smallest working solution.
- **Provider-neutral product:** choose infrastructure based on technical fit; do not imply affiliation.
- **Production-aware:** think about security, data, deploys, monitoring, growth, discoverability, analytics, and maintenance early.
- **Beginner-safe:** explain decisions in plain language before deep engineering detail.
- **AI-ready:** write instructions clearly enough for coding agents to follow.
- **Freshness-aware:** verify changing provider/platform facts against official sources.

## Contributing

DeveloperB and the toolkit should be useful for real projects, justified, safe, clear about uncertainty, and understandable by both people and AI coding agents. Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before adding guides.

## The promise

> Help people move from real problems to complete, launch-ready, maintainable products without wasting developer time, money, or AI effort.
